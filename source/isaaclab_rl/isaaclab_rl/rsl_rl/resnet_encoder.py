class ResNet18Encoder(nn.Module):
    """ResNet18 encoder with ImageNet pretrained weights for vision-based RL.

    This encoder uses a pretrained ResNet18 (ImageNet weights) as a feature extractor.
    The final fully-connected layer is removed, and a linear projection layer is added
    to map the 512-dimensional ResNet features to the desired output dimension.

    The encoder supports:
    - Frozen mode: ResNet weights are frozen (eval mode, no gradients)
    - Finetuning mode: ResNet weights can be trained (train mode, gradients enabled)

    Image normalization uses ImageNet statistics (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    which matches the pretrained weights.

    Args:
        output_dim: The output dimension of the encoder (after linear projection). Defaults to 32.
        device: The device to run the encoder on. Defaults to "cuda".
        train_resnet: Whether ResNet weights should be trainable. Defaults to False (frozen).
